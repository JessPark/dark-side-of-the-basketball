# Dark Side of the Basketball
##Description:
Dark Side of the Basketball is a Ruby/Rails app that combines two APIs to let you know if your city has any NCAA men's basketball games scheduled, and the weather!  

##Details:
Dark Side of the Basketball is built with Rails 4.2.0 and includes several gems. Please bundle install after downloading from GitHub. To find this app on Heroku, please visit  https://dark-side-of-the-basketball.herokuapp.com/api/v1/current_weather/{state code}/{city}, replacing {state code with the two-letter abbreviation for your state and {city} with the city. For instance,
https://dark-side-of-the-basketball.herokuapp.com/api/v1/current_weather/ny/albany would tell you the daily scheduled games and the weather in the city of Albany, NY.
